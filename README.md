## Features
- preprocessing the traffic raw data before classifying (now only support `*.pcap` and `*.pcapng`), if you input  `*.pcapng`  and help you reshape to `*.pcap`

- define your input traffic package and support two types of classification(2 or 14). 2 means classify your traffic as benign or malicious, 14 means user behaviors' classification. 

## Support OS

Now, only support **Linux** and **macOS**. If you use **Windows**, It's fine to use **WSL** or **virtual machine**(Vmware or virtual box).   
***support üê≥Docker already.***
